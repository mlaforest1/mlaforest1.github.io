<h1>Work History</h1>
<p>I started to work when I was 15 as a councelor at the local summer camp in my town. I worked there for 2 summers before I got a year round job at my local Kmart. I worked as a cashier there for a little before being moved to work in the warehouse. After the Kmart closed I got a job bringing products between a local chain of gas staions, and frequently fill in cashier shifts. I am currently still employed for Verc Enterprises.<p>
