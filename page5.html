<h1>Education</h1>
    <p>I graduated from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in 2015. From there I attended the University of South Carolina to study bio-metical engineering. After my first semester I transferred to the University of Maine, and switched my major to computer science. After struggling in that major for a year and a half, I switched my major to finance this semester.<p>
