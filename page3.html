<h1>Hobbies</h1>

<p>When i'm not doing school work or working, there are a few things I enjoy doing to pass my time. I'm an avid sports fan, and while I enjoy watching all the Boston sports teams, my favourite to watch are the Patriots and the Bruins. I also enjoy skiing and playing hockey, and have recently been trying to pick up golf. When I'm not doing those activities, I'm usually hanging out with friends, or napping.<p>
